    "In this Final Project, we reproduced the unsupervised deep learning approach to solving partial integro-differential equations reported in Weilong Fu & Ali Hirsa (2022) Quantitative Finance, 22:8, 1481-1494. Based on the underlying Lévy process with jumps, the partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) is employed for option pricing. The approach employs a neural network as the candidate solution and trains the neural network to satisfy the PIDE. It does not require any labels for training. By matching the PIDE and the boundary conditions, the neural network would yield an accurate solution to the PIDE. Additional singular terms are added to the neural network to satisfy the non-smooth initial conditions."

    "\n",
    "Lévy processes describes the fat tails of asset returns and matching theimplied volatility surfaces in option markets better than difusion models. The partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) is used to solve option prices under the models based on Lévy processes. The difference between a PIDE and a partial differential equation (PDE) is that a PIDE contains an integral term, which is generated by jumps in Lévy processes. For this reason, the PIDE is harder to be solved. Several mathematical approaches, such as the finite difference method or the fast Fourier transform, and approaches based on supervised deep learning have been utilized. \n",

    "In Weilong Fu & Ali Hirsa (2022) Quantitative Finance, 22:8, 1481-1494, an unsupervised deep learning approach to solving partial integro-differential equations has been reported. In the paper, apricing method of European/American calls/puts in the models based on Lévy processes by solving the PIDE with a neural network is proposed. The neural network is used as the approximated price surface. It only needs to be trained once and is then able to generate prices fast. The difference from supervised approaches is that this approach is self-contained, which does not need pre-calculated labels of option prices. In option pricing, the final payoff (the initial condition) is not a smooth function, which contradicts the smooth neural network. Thus, additional features called singular terms to satisfy the non-smooth property of the initial conditions is contained in the neural network. "
